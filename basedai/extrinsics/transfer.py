            If set, waits for the extrinsic to enter a block before returning ``true``, or returns ``false`` if the extrinsic fails to enter the block within the timeout.
        wait_for_finalization (bool):
            If set, waits for the extrinsic to be finalized on the chain before returning ``true``, or returns ``false`` if the extrinsic fails to be finalized within the timeout.
        keep_alive (bool):
            If set, keeps the account alive by keeping the balance above the existential deposit.

            Flag is ``true`` if extrinsic was finalized or uncluded in the block. If we did not wait for finalization / inclusion, the response is ``true``.
